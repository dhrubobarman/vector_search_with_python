Creating a GitHub README for Your Python Project with MongoDB Vector Search and Hugging Face Sentence Transformer

Introduction
Welcome to your new Python project! This README will guide you through the setup, features, and usage of your application, which leverages the power of MongoDB's vector search and Hugging Face's sentence transformer.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- MongoDB atlas account
- [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhrubobarman/vector_search_with_python.git
cd your-project-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configuration
Configure your secrets in the `.env` file:

```python
DB_URL = your_mongodb_uri
HF_TOKEN = hugging_face_token
```
I am using here [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Usage
To use the vector search with MongoDB, first create a search index your data:


```python
  {
    "mappings":{
      "dynamic": true,
      "fields":{
        "plot_embedding_hf": {
          "dimension": 384,
          "similarity": "dotProduct",
          "type": "knnVector"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```


The `search` function utilizes the Hugging Face sentence transformer to convert the query into a vector and searches the MongoDB collection for the most relevant documents.

Conclusion
With this setup, you're ready to explore the capabilities of vector search in MongoDB with the power of Hugging Face's sentence transformers. Happy coding!
